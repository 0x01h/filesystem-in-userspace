INSTALLATION
$ sudo apt install libfuse-dev

USAGE OF HELLO.C
1) Compile: "gcc hello.c -o hello -Wall -ansi -W -std=c99 -g -ggdb -D_GNU_SOURCE -D_FILE_OFFSET_BITS=64 -lfuse"
2) Create a temporary directory: "mkdir tmp"
3) Execute hello.o: 
  "./hello tmp"
  tmp, is the "mount point"
  hello.c then creates a file called "hello" inside the mount point.
4) Check the temporary directory: ls tmp
  This should list a file called "hello".
5) Inside the file there will be a sentence, "Hello World!": 
  "cat tmp/hello"
6) To unmount filesystem use "fusermount -u tmp".

USAGE OF ROFS.C
1) Compile: "gcc rofs.c -o rofs -Wall -ansi -W -std=c99 -g -ggdb -D_GNU_SOURCE -D_FILE_OFFSET_BITS=64 -lfuse"
2) Mount, Option 1: "./rofs readwrite_filesystem mount_point"
          Option 2: "./rofs test1 test2"
3) Additional commands: "ls -l" and "grep rofs /etc/mtab"
4) To unmount filesystem use "fusermount -u mount_point".

mtab: This file lists all currently mounted filesystems.

COMPLETED STAGES
1) Skim the slides and add comments to the source codes.
2) Compile & run: hello.c, rofs.c
3) Create documentation.
4) Prepare a basic website folder.
5) Implement FUSE system as requested: 
	- Mirror a folder with same structure.
	- Make mirrored folder read only.
	- Reflect any changes immediately.

IMPLEMENTATION OF MIRROR FOLDER
1) Compile rofs.c: "gcc rofs.c -o rofs -Wall -ansi -W -std=c99 -g -ggdb -D_GNU_SOURCE -D_FILE_OFFSET_BITS=64 -lfuse"
2) Manually create a folder that will mirror another folder: you can name it as "mirror".
3) Mount rofs, specialized for the purpose: "./rofs -d website/ mirror/"
This should take half a minute to complete. 
Then you can access the mirrored folder. 
As said above, mirror folder has the same structure, is read only and reflects any changes immediately.

FURTHER STAGES
1- Implement HTML Tidy, and create a not-tidy version of home.html file (to be tidied by rofs).
2- Review and upload.
